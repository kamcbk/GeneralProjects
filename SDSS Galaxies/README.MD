# SDSS Galaxies


### What is SDSS?
The Slogan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an optical telescope in New Mexico, US dedicated to spectral imaging and spectroscopic surveying. It's currently being used to survey the sky using redshift, creating a clearer 
image of our sky

### What is this project?
We use machine learning to model and identify galaxies in this dataset. We use both classification and regression models to determine whether something is a galaxy or not.
