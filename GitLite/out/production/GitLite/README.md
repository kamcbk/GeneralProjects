# GitLite: A Simple, Local, Version Control File Tracker

## About
GitLite is a local version control system similar to Git. It's a mock version of Git with only local features, using basic data structures, hence the Lite in GitLite. Several commands and functions from Git are included in GitLite, from *add* and *commit* to *branch* and *reset*. Other commands, like *find*, are brand new.

## Acknowledgments
This project could not have been done without the following people:

- Joseph Moghadam, Paul Hilfinger, and the [CS61B](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19) course and staff.
