# GeneralProjects
A general list of projects done in school or independently.

Over the past 5 years I've accumulated about +20 projects. My current TODO is to upload them onto this repository for record and reproducibility. Some of the projects you'll see here in the future include:

* Using ML for an Ising Model (Physics)
* Measuring the Radius of the Sun and the Moon 
* Hollywood Diversity Dataset
* Country vs Rap Song Classification

I'll also be uploading any current projects I work on presently.
