# GeneralProjects
A general list of projects done in school or independently. 

Over the past 5 years I've accumulated about +20 projects. My current TODO is to upload them onto this repository for record and reproducibility. Most of these projects have been recreated and redone, often involving me starting from scratch. Thus, most of see has been made by me unless noted.

Some of the projects you'll see here in the future include:

* Using ML for an Ising Model (Physics)
* Measuring the Radius of the Sun and the Moon 
* Hollywood Diversity Dataset
I'll also be uploading any current projects I work on presently.
