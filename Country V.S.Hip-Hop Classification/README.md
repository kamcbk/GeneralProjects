## About
This classification project distinguishing country and hip-hop music based on lyrics using datasets collected from http://millionsongdataset.com. Using a homemade kNN algorithm, I compare my results with [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)'s kNN package. Though not entirely shown, through multiple trials, my analysis was able conclude that my algorithm produce similar results to Sklearn's. 

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.5+.
* Able to run Jupyter notebooks with numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and sklearn.

## Limitiations
* KNN algorithm was only tested on classification dataset. Though I designed it in mind to be able to be replicated with other data, it is not tested. Use at your own risk.

## Authors
* Kevin Marroquin
* UC Berkeley's Data 8 Course for a fast distance function

## Acknowledgments
- [UC Berkeley's Data 8](http://data8.org/su17/) course for their clean music dataset and fast distance function algorithm.
- [Sam Lau](https://www.samlau.me) for his amazing explainations of the kNN algorithm.
- [Eleanor Amidei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eleanoramidei/) for working with me originally on this project. While none of the work she constructed remains in this repository, her ideas, contribution, and time aided to what you see here today.
